## Security Best Practices

### 🔐 **General Application Security**
- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API access

### 🎤 **Microphone Permission Handling**
- Always request microphone permissions explicitly
- Provide clear explanations for why microphone access is needed
- Implement graceful degradation when permissions are denied
- Use secure contexts (HTTPS) for accessing microphone APIs
- Monitor for permission changes and handle them appropriately

### 🌐 **Browser Security Considerations**
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### 🚫 **Data Minimization**
- Process audio client-side when possible
- Avoid storing unnecessary audio metadata
- Implement automatic data purging policies
- Use privacy-preserving techniques when applicable
- Provide transparency about data usage

## Browser Security Considerations

### 🌍 **Cross-Origin Security**
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure cross-origin communication patterns
- Validate all external resource loading
- Implement CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- Use SRI (Subresource Integrity) for external scripts

### 🔒 **Client-Side Security**
- Implement proper input validation
- Use secure coding practices to prevent XSS
- Protect against CSRF attacks
- Implement secure session management
- Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data

### 📱 **Mobile Browser Security**
- Implement mobile-specific security measures
- Handle touch events securely
- Use secure communication over mobile networks
- Implement proper offline data security
- Consider mobile-specific privacy concerns

## Third-Party Dependencies

### 📦 **Dependency Management**
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Monitor security advisories for used packages
- Consider using dependency scanning tools in CI/CD

### 🔍 **Security Scanning**
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- Use tools like Snyk, WhiteSource, or GitHub security features
- Perform regular security assessments
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Implement security testing in development workflow

## Compliance & Regulations

### 📜 **Privacy Regulations**
- **GDPR**: Ensure compliance with European privacy laws
- **CCPA**: Follow California privacy requirements
