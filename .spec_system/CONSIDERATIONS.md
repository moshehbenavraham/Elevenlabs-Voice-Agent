## Active Concerns

Items requiring attention in upcoming phases. Review before each session.

### Technical Debt
<!-- Max 5 items -->

*None yet - add items as technical debt accumulates.*

### External Dependencies
<!-- Max 5 items -->

1. **xAI Realtime API** - No official React SDK; using native WebSocket with ephemeral tokens
2. **ElevenLabs SDK** - Currently v0.12.1; monitor for breaking changes

### Performance / Security
<!-- Max 5 items -->

1. **API Keys** - Must use backend proxy for xAI (ephemeral token pattern); never expose in browser
2. **HTTPS Required** - Microphone access requires HTTPS in production

### Architecture
<!-- Max 5 items -->

1. **Separate Contexts per Provider** - VoiceContext is ElevenLabs-specific; add XAIVoiceContext for xAI
2. **Single Connection at a Time** - Disconnect active provider before switching tabs

---

## Lessons Learned

Proven patterns and anti-patterns. Reference during implementation.

### What Worked
<!-- Max 15 items -->

1. **useConnectionMode hook** - Environment-based switching pattern is reusable for providers
2. **Glassmorphism design** - backdrop-blur + semi-transparent backgrounds create consistent UI
3. **Existing server/index.js** - Already has Express + CORS + dotenv; extend rather than rewrite

### What to Avoid
<!-- Max 10 items -->

1. **Exposing API keys to browser** - Always use backend proxy for sensitive credentials
2. **Simultaneous connections** - Resource management is cleaner with single active provider

### Tool/Library Notes
<!-- Max 5 items -->

1. **@elevenlabs/react** - Uses signed URL pattern for secure connections
2. **Framer Motion** - Already integrated; use for tab transition animations
