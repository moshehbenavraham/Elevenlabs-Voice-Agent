## ✅ THEME TOGGLE REMOVED ✅

**NON-FUNCTIONAL THEME TOGGLE CLEANED UP**

### What Was Done:
1. **✅ Removed Theme Toggle Button** - No longer shows in header
2. **✅ Cleaned Up Import** - Removed unused ThemeToggle import
3. **✅ Simplified Header** - Now only shows settings button
4. **✅ Tests Pass** - Build and lint successful

### Why It Was Removed:
- Theme toggle only affected hidden UI components
- All visual elements hard-coded for dark theme
- Toggle appeared to do nothing to users
- App is designed as dark-theme-first

## ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX COMPLETED ✅

**AGENT ID EXPOSURE VULNERABILITY FIXED**

### Security Issues Resolved:
1. **✅ Agent ID Exposure** - Removed display of private Agent ID in UI
2. **✅ Removed Input Field** - No longer shows actual Agent ID value
3. **✅ Removed Save/Cancel Buttons** - Eliminated misleading controls that didn't function
4. **✅ Added GitHub Link** - Replaced sensitive content with open source repository link
5. **✅ Simplified Modal** - Now only shows configuration status without exposing credentials

### What Changed:
- **Before**: Modal displayed actual Agent ID value from .env file (security risk)
- **After**: Modal only shows "Agent ID is configured" or "Please configure" status
- **GitHub Link Added**: https://github.com/moshehbenavraham/Elevenlabs-Voice-Agent
- **X Close Button**: Works properly for closing the modal
- **No Data Exposure**: Private credentials remain private

### Previous Issues Also Fixed:

### Result:
- **Security Enhanced**: No private data exposed in UI
- **User Friendly**: Clear status messaging without complexity
