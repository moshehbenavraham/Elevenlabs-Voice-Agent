# Changelog

All notable changes to the Voice Chat Interface will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Smooth breathing animation for idle state of VoiceOrb component
- Organic pulsing patterns with varying intensity across all orb states
- Enhanced scale, shadow, and opacity transitions for more sophisticated animations
- Complex multi-keyframe animations for connected and speaking states
- **NEW:** Morphing transitions between orb states with dynamic border-radius changes
- **NEW:** Floating/hovering effects with Y-axis animation across all states
- **NEW:** Advanced AudioVisualizer with multi-frequency bands (128 bars vs 64)
- **NEW:** Radial spectrum visualization with 3D depth effects
- **NEW:** Dynamic color shifting based on audio intensity and voice state
- **NEW:** Particle system around orb edges with intelligent movement
- **NEW:** Enhanced glass morphism with multiple variants (glass-enhanced, glass-frosted)
- **NEW:** BackgroundEffects component with floating geometric elements
- **NEW:** Advanced animation utilities (float, morph, ripple)

### Enhanced
- VoiceOrb idle state now includes subtle breathing effect with 3-second duration
- Loading state features organic pulsing with rotation effects  
- Connected state animations vary based on speaking status with more dynamic transitions
- Improved visual feedback through layered animation effects
- **NEW:** AudioVisualizer now features ripple effects, central pulse, and frequency particles
- **NEW:** All glass elements upgraded to enhanced variants for better depth
- **NEW:** Background dynamically responds to speaking state with gradient shifts
