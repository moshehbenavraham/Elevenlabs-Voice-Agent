# ElevenLabs Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# Make sure NOT to save this file to your repository and is in all the proper "ignore" files such as .gitignore

# ElevenLabs Agent ID for voice conversations
# Get this from your ElevenLabs dashboard under Conversational AI
# This is safe to expose client-side as it only identifies the agent
VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_your_agent_id_here

# Development mode flag
VITE_NODE_ENV=development

# ============================================================
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: API Keys
# ============================================================
# DO NOT use VITE_ prefix for API keys - they get exposed in the client bundle!
#
# For production deployments requiring API key authentication:
# 1. Create a backend proxy that holds the API key server-side
# 2. Have your frontend call your backend, which then calls ElevenLabs
# 3. Store the key in server-side environment variables only
#
# Example server-side variable (NOT exposed to client):
# ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_your_api_key_here
