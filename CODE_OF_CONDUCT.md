# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

  overall community

  advances of any kind

## Voice AI Community Standards

Given the nature of our project involving voice AI and audio processing, we have additional community standards:

### Respectful Voice Content

* **Content Guidelines**: When sharing voice recordings, audio samples, or discussing voice features, ensure content is appropriate and respectful
* **Privacy Respect**: Do not share audio recordings of others without explicit consent
* **Inclusive Language**: Use inclusive language when discussing voice characteristics, accents, or speech patterns
* **Accessibility Awareness**: Be mindful that community members may have different hearing abilities, speech patterns, or communication preferences

### Technical Discussions

* **Constructive Feedback**: When reviewing voice AI implementations, provide constructive and educational feedback
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Share knowledge about voice AI, audio processing, and accessibility in a way that helps others learn
* **Beginner-Friendly**: Remember that voice AI is a complex field - be patient and helpful with those learning
* **Safety First**: When discussing voice AI applications, consider and promote ethical use cases and user safety

### Audio and Voice Considerations

* **Accessibility**: Always consider how voice features impact users with different abilities
* **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be aware that voice, language, and communication styles vary across cultures
* **Technical Accuracy**: Strive for technical accuracy when discussing voice AI concepts, APIs, and implementations
* **User Privacy**: Respect and promote best practices for handling user audio data and privacy

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
